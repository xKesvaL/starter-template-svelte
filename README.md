# Svelte Starter Template

This is my svelte starter template using material design's UI and following atomic design. [What Is Atomic Design ?](#what-is-atomic-design)

## What Is Atomic Design

To summarize [[this article]](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/), Atomic Design is destructuring a website into little portions of itself. It has 5 stages :

1. Atoms
2. Molecules
3. Organisms
4. Templates
5. Pages

### Atoms

Atoms are often pure HTML elements, like a button, an input, things that can't be destructured any more.

### Molecules

Molecules are groups of atoms together, here, we will see them as simple structures of atoms together, a search bar for example. A mix of a label, input and a button.
